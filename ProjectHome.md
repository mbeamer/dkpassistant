DKP Assistant(DKPA) is an semi-automated raid tool to assist with creating raids, awarding dkp and distributing loot with EQDKP in EverQuest.

It works by monitoring your log file to capture "DKPA commands" in a specified channel which will handle your loot.  A few of the many features it allows you to do is: start a new raid, award loot to players, automate the bidding process, and automatically submit the created raids to EQDKP without any work for you.

It's extremely easy to use, and greatly reduces the time and hastle required when running the DKP system manually.
